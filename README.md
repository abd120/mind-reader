Dearest earthicans, this is a script written in your species programming language known as Python.
It asks you to pick a number between 1 and 63. It uses a simple trick based on the numbers in each set, the way they progress as you go on and their placement in each set. 
The algorothim is pretty easy, there are 6^6 (46656) combinations of checked boxes, for each checked box, a variable will be added to an array, which will change as you progress in the sets, by the sixth set, the sum of the variable in the array is the number you chose. 
It's called magic kids.
